# ElectronicsDepot is a simulation of an online ecommerce website. Here a potential customer can view what is for sale on the website
and add selected items to their basket for later checkout. If the customer decides to cancel then they can also remove 
the item from their basket and continue. The staple of this project is the use of Javascript, PHP, HTML, CSS, and SQLite. Much credit
to my partner Anthony Jones for great mutual effort on the development of this project!
